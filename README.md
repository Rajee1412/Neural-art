# Neural-art

This is a TensorFlow implementation of the Neural stye transfer based on the original work by Gatys et.al - https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576. 
Pretrained VGG-19 model has been used from http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/pretrained/.

Style images used here is self protrait by Van Gough (https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vincent_Willem_van_Gogh_102.jpg) and some personal selfie images were used as content

# Next steps
Use image tranformation network based on the work by Johnson et.al

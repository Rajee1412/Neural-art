# Neural-art

This is a TensorFlow implementation of the Neural stye transfer based on the original work by Gatys et.al - https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576. 
Pretrained VGG-19 model has been used from http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/pretrained/
Style images were gathered from google and some personal selfie images were used as content (TODO: post some examples)

# Next steps
Use image tranformation network based on the work by Johnson et.al
